            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! I'm Tristan, a computer science student in the LSA Honors Program at the University of Michigan. 
                I'm deeply passionate about software engineering and videogame development. I am a member of 
                <a href="https://wolverinesoft.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WolverineSoft</a>, 
                a game development club, and 
                <a href="https://michigancg.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michigan Computer Graphics</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to create unique, memorable experiences through games that motivate others to explore their passions. 
                I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'd love to share that experience with you.

                    48 hour game jam submission following the theme "Block Party." This game is a 2-player dynamic rhythm-based game where players
                    synchronize actions to musical beats to outperform their opponent. There are 3 unique tracks, a regular and halloween them,
                    and 9 unique characters to select from. This project was designed using C#11 inside of the Unity Game Engine.

                    48 hour game jam submission following the theme "Counterproductive." This game is an asymetical, cooperative, infinite runner.
                    Each game consists of a turkey, and a builder, who work together to progress as far as possible. This project was created using 
                    Blender 4.3 for models and animations, and was programmed using C#11 inside the Unity Game Engine.

                <p>
                    This 24 hour game jam was my first formal introduction to Unity and C#. Unlike typical game jams, all teams worked together to
                    create one project, "WolveyWare," a parody of "WarioWare." Each person created a WarioWare like minigame to all be compiled together.
                    My minigame, "Hide your Sins," was one of the games included. It was designed using C#11 inside of the Unity Game Engine.
